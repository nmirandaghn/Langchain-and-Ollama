      "On the other hand, the moon is not technically a satellite, but rather a natural satellite that orbits the Earth. It's a rocky, airless body that was once part of the Earth's mantle but was broken off and later coaxed into orbit by the gravitational force of the Earth. The moon is about 2,159 miles (3,475 kilometers) away from our planet and has its own unique characteristics, such as tides and phases.\n",

      "* A star is a massive ball of hot gas with intense energy.\n",
      "* Objects in space that are not stars (like planets, moons, asteroids) do not generate their own light and heat through nuclear reactions.\n",
      "* Satellites, on the other hand, are typically artificial objects designed to orbit a celestial body. They can be man-made or unmanned, but they're often referred to as \"sats\" due to their connection to satellites in space.\n",

In this context, the moon is not a star itself but rather a distinct object that exists independently of the sun.

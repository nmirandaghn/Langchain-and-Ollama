      "The earliest human civilizations emerged around 200,000 years ago in the Oldowan culture, followed by the development of Homo sapiens around 50,000 years ago. This marked the beginning of modern human history.\n",

      "During this period, early humans migrated out of Africa and spread across the globe, adapting to various environments and developing distinct cultures.\n",

      "As civilizations developed, so did their societies, governments, and technologies. Some notable ancient civilizations include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Sumeria (c. 4500 - 1900 BCE): Mesopotamia's \"cradle of civilization,\" where cities like Ur and Babylon flourished.\n",
      "* Ancient Egypt (c. 3100 - 30 BCE): One of the most influential civilizations, known for their pyramids, mummies, and pharaohs.\n",
      "* Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300 - 1300 BCE): Located in modern-day Pakistan and India, this civilization is famous for its sophisticated urban planning and water management systems.\n",
      "* Ancient Greece (c. 800 - 146 CE) and Rome (c. 753 BCE - 476 CE): These civilizations made significant contributions to philosophy, art, architecture, and governance.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Middle Ages saw the rise of feudalism, the Crusades, and the spread of Christianity throughout Europe. The Islamic Golden Age (8th - 13th centuries) also flourished in the Middle East, marking a significant cultural and scientific shift.\n",

      "**Early Modern Period (c. 1500 - 1800 CE)**\n",

The atmosphere traps heat from the sun, maintaining a warm temperature of about 15°C (59°F) on average. This is known as the \"greenhouse effect,\" which keeps the planet habitable.\n",

      "3. **Water Cycle**: Water covers approximately 71% of the Earth's surface and plays a vital role in sustaining life. It flows through rivers, lakes, and oceans, eventually returning to the atmosphere as water vapor or precipitation. The Earth's water cycle is constantly cycled, with about 96.5% of it evaporating back into space annually.\n"
